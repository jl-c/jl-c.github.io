title: Renewal

I write this in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. I've been having a lot of thoughts lately: on how to use my time, on what gives me a sense of joy and purpose, and on the interests currently engaging my curiosity.

I used to blog to make sense of such musings, and I have been meaning to revisit the practice. I would also like to get back into the habit of regular writingâ€”about whatever comes to mind. I've set up this site to have a simple interface: just a series of posts sorted in reverse chronological order. Anything more complex than that, and I risk overthinking design at the cost of content.
