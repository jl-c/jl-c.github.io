title: Swayed by a Notion

---
Getting back into blogging has led me to be more mindful of my workflow. As with any creative endeavour, it pays dividends to remove obstacles to productivity (in the ultimate etymological sense—from the Latin _producere_—to "lead forth or bring out").

For the last several years, I've used Google Drive and its suite of tools to produce. It was most certainly the killer app during my time in grad school, but now that my day job is based on Microsoft Office and as I become increasingly wary of Google when it comes to privacy, some changes were due.

Enter: Notion, the service that describes itself (aptly) "the all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases." I created an account two days ago for a trial run, and I'm already planning how to migrate my life onto it.

If I had to describe Notion in a few lines, it's having a blank canvas to create links between pages, with the latter functioning as notes, lists, digital assets, and tables. The appeal is in the customizability of the system. My description is doing Notion a disservice (there's a lot more functionality that I either haven't discovered yet or am not bothering with since my needs are basic), so let me show my dashboard.

![My Notion dashboard](/uploads/notion.png "My Notion dashboard")I draw parallels between Notion and bullet journaling. Both are productivity tools that lend themselves to really cool designs, but with both, I tend to focus less on the aesthetics and more on function. And since form follows function, you can see that my dashboard is clustered by my intentions. The headers _Personal_, _Play_, and _Work_ are common clusters on the dashboards I've seen. It makes sense because Notion can keep track of one's activity (like a bullet journal), their interests (like a commonplace book or scrapbook), and work (like a portfolio).

The header _Poetry_ is akin to having a header for projects. I want to value this activity as its own category, hence its single link. Finally, as a reflection of my top-down ways of thinking, I have under _Misc_. my personal theory of change—a list of identified factors, inputs, outputs, outcomes, assumptions, and methods of measuring impact that is basically the story I tell myself about how I'll get to where I want to go; a vision board that collects images and quotes (and, unlike a physical vision board, some videos and songs) to remind myself of better days to come; and a philosophy for how to use Notion (similar to a style guide for design, but with considerations for functionality—this is a way to remind myself _why_ I am using the tool).

Unless I run into glaring issues, Notion is on track to replace Google Drive as my main productivity hub. It's light, quick, and even _fun_ to use. I'm actually excited to dabble in poetry tonight.

Oh, and in case I'm giving off the impression with my dashboard (and heck, this blog itself…) that I am aesthetically dull, I say to you, "au contraire."
