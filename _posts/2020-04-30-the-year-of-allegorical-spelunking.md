title: The Year of Allegorical Spelunking

---
So ends the month in which I turned 28. I cannot in good conscience continue saying I'm in my mid-20s; I'm now in my late 20s and—as with all milestones of adulthood (to my knowledge)—that means coming to terms with what to release into the past and what to look forward to in the future.

This isn't me mourning the loss of bygone days. I am for the most part quite content with the shape of my life so far, and I am confident that even better days await. What is noteworthy about this time in my life is that it feels like a transitional chapter: I recognize I am no longer who I used to be, and yet I also know I am unfinished—there remains much in my life to explore, discover, and enjoy.

To give emotional weight to this awareness, I have dubbed the next 12 months "the Year of Allegorical Spelunking" (a play on Joan Didion's vividly titled book, _The Year of Magical Thinking_). While Didion's work examines grief in the context of losing of a loved one, I hope for my year ahead to be an examination of self-authorship, and an unearthing of a deeper sense of self.

Luke Skywalker was tasked to enter the dark side cave on Dagobah as part of his training (_The Empire Strikes Back_). Bruce Wayne needed to enter the caves housing his childhood fear to set up a lair in his crusade against crime in Gotham City (_Batman Begins_). The ancestor of the Romans, Aeneas, descended into the underworld via a cavern to converse with his deceased father, at the midpoint of his journey between Troy and Italy (_The Aeneid_).

In all these narratives, the mythic notion of descent, or _katabasis_, is essential to the protagonist's progress. "The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek," advised the mythologist and humanist Joseph Campbell. This is the philosophy I seek to enact in my own life in the year ahead.
